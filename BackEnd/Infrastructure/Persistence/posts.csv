1994-07-09T12:30:00Z;Scar;Life is not fair, is it, my little friend? While some are born to feast, others spend their lives in the dark, begging for scraps.
1994-07-09T12:32:00Z;Scar;I answer to no one
1994-07-09T12:33:00Z;Mufasa;One day, It'll be my son who rules
1994-10-15T09:00:00Z;Mufasa;Look Simba! Everything the light touches is our kingdom
1994-10-15T09:00:10Z;Simba (cub);You rule ALL of that?!
1994-10-15T09:00:15Z;Mufasa;Yes, but a king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.
1994-10-15T09:00:20Z;Simba (cub);All of this will belong to me?
1994-10-15T09:00:25Z;Mufasa;It belongs to no one, but will be yours to protect. A great responsibility.
1994-10-15T09:00:30Z;Simba (cub);Everything the light touches? Those trees? And the watering hole? And that mountain? And... beyond those shadows?
1994-10-15T09:00:35Z;Mufasa;You must not go there Simba!
1994-10-15T09:00:40Z;Simba (cub);But I thought a king could do whatever he wants! Take any territory!
1994-10-15T09:00:45Z;Mufasa;While others search for what they can take, a true king searches for what he can give.
1994-10-16T10:00:00Z;Scar;Go back to your den, Simba. I don't babysit.
1994-10-16T10:00:05Z;Simba (cub);Babysit? I'm gonna be the king of Pride Rock! My dad showed me the whole kingdom! Said I'm going to rule it all!
1994-10-16T10:00:10Z;Scar;Is that so?
1994-10-16T10:00:15Z;Simba (cub);Think about it! When I'm king, I'll have to give YOU orders! Tell YOU what to do! How weird is that?
1994-10-16T10:00:20Z;Scar;You've no idea... So your dad showed you the whole kingdom? Did he show you the shadows beyond the northern borders?
1994-10-16T10:00:25Z;Simba (cub);No... He said I can't go there. Ever.
1994-10-16T10:00:30Z;Scar;And he is absolutely right. An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.
1994-10-16T10:00:35Z;Simba (cub);An elephant graveyard?! Wow!
1994-10-16T10:00:40Z;Scar;Oh dear! I've said to much! Well I suppose you'd find out sooner or later, you being... KING... and all...
1994-10-16T10:00:45Z;Simba (cub);You've been there???
1994-10-16T10:00:50Z;Scar;We've all been there! It's no place for a cub. All those roting bones... and burning pools of oozing mud...
1994-10-16T10:00:55Z;Simba (cub);Roting bones?! Oozing mud?!
1994-10-16T10:01:00Z;Scar;Promise me you'll stay away, Simba! Now, you run along. And remember... it's our little secret... your majesty...
1994-10-16T10:05:00Z;Simba (cub);Nala! C'mon, we have to go!
1994-10-16T10:07:00Z;Simba (cub);I've heard about this place, Nala! The most incredible, amazing! [...] An elephant... GRAVEYARD!
1994-10-16T10:07:05Z;Nala (cub);Wow! How far is it?
1994-10-16T10:07:10Z;Simba (cub);Not far. Just to the shadows. But don't worry, everyone's been there!
1994-10-16T10:07:15Z;Nala (cub);We've never went that far before. What if we get lost?
1994-10-16T10:07:20Z;Simba (cub);Relax, Nala! I patroled the entire kingdom this morning with my dad! There's nothing to worry about.
1994-10-16T10:20:30Z;Zazu;Simba, you can't escape your destiny!
1994-10-16T10:40:00Z;Simba (cub);I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware! [...] Oh, I just can't wait to be king! No one saying do this, no one saying be there, no one saying stop that, no one saying see here!. Free to run around all day, free to do it all my way! Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
1994-10-16T13:00:00Z;Simba (cub);This must be it! C'mon!
1994-10-16T13:00:05Z;Nala (cub);Simba, we're way beyond the Pride Lands.
1994-10-16T13:00:10Z;Simba (cub);We found it Nala! You know what this means?
1994-10-16T13:00:15Z;Nala (cub);It means we can go home!
1994-10-16T13:00:20Z;Simba (cub);It means they won't treat us like cubs anymore.
1994-10-16T13:05:30Z;Simba (cub);I laugh in the face of danger! HAHAHA!
1994-10-16T13:10:30Z;Shenzi;Now, this is a meal I've waited my whole life for! What an unexpected treat! To eat the son of a king! Mufasa does not rule me!
1994-10-16T13:10:35Z;Simba (cub);You can't do anything to me! 'Cause I'm the future king!
1994-10-16T13:10:40Z;Shenzi;I wonder how all that bravery will taste!
1994-10-16T13:10:50Z;Zazu;If you do this, you will start a war with Mufasa!
1994-10-16T13:11:00Z;Shenzi;Hyenas and lions have been at war since the beginning of time! But Mufasa's bloodline will end here!
1994-10-16T13:12:30Z;Mufasa;If you ever come near my son again...!
1994-10-16T13:12:35Z;Shenzi;No, Mufasa. Never. Never again.
1994-10-16T13:12:40Z;Mufasa;You've been warned, Shenzi!
1994-10-16T13:12:45Z;Nala (cub);(To Simba) I thought you were very brave.
1994-10-16T19:00:00Z;Mufasa;Simba, you deliberately disobeyed me! You could have been killed! And what's worse, you put Nala in danger! Do you understand what's at stake? You jeopardized the future of our pride!
1994-10-16T19:00:05Z;Simba (cub);I just wanted to show you I could do it! That I could be brave like you!
1994-10-16T19:00:10Z;Mufasa;I'm only brave when I have to be, when there's no other choice.
1994-10-16T19:00:15Z;Simba (cub);But... You're not scared of anything.
1994-10-16T19:00:20Z;Mufasa;I was today...
1994-10-16T19:00:25Z;Simba (cub);You were?!
1994-10-16T19:00:30Z;Mufasa;Yes! I thought I'd might lose you.
1994-10-16T19:00:35Z;Simba (cub);I guess even kings get scared, huh?!
1994-10-16T19:00:40Z;Mufasa;More than you could ever know.
1994-10-16T19:00:45Z;Simba (cub);But guess what?
1994-10-16T19:00:50Z;Mufasa;What?
1994-10-16T19:00:55Z;Simba (cub);I think those hyenas were even scareder!
1994-10-16T19:01:00Z;Mufasa;That's 'cause nobody messes with your dad!
1994-10-16T19:05:00Z;Mufasa;Simba, let me tell you something my father told me. Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars.
1994-10-16T19:05:05Z;Simba (cub);Really?
1994-10-16T19:05:10Z;Mufasa;Yes! So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kings will always be up there to guide you. And so will I.
1994-10-16T19:05:00Z;Simba (cub);But I can't see them, dad!
1994-10-16T19:05:00Z;Mufasa;Keep looking son. Keep looking.
1994-10-17T20:00:00Z;Scar;You fools have stripped you land of every living thing. And yet I send two little cubs your way, and they come back alive!
1994-10-17T20:00:05Z;Kamari;I guess we'll have to eat you instead.
1994-10-17T20:00:10Z;Shenzi;What could you possibly offer us?
1994-10-17T20:00:15Z;Scar;A place where you can fill your bellies. Where everything the light touches is yours for the kill.
1994-10-17T20:00:20Z;Shenzi;The Pride Lands are not yours to give. The king controls those hunting grounds.
1994-10-17T20:00:25Z;Scar;That's why we're going to kill him.
1994-10-18T10:00:00Z;Simba (cub);My dad was pretty upset with me.
1994-10-18T10:00:05Z;Scar;That's why we're here Simba. I think I know a way for you to make it up to him. A gift that will make him forget it ever happened.
1994-10-18T10:00:10Z;Simba (cub);But he's the king! What could I give him?
1994-10-18T10:00:15Z;Scar;Your roar!
1994-10-18T10:00:20Z;Simba (cub);My roar?
1994-10-18T10:00:25Z;Scar;Yes! ... Did you hear that? This gorge is where all lions come to find their roar.
1994-10-18T10:00:30Z;Simba (cub);All lions? Even my dad?
1994-10-18T10:00:35Z;Scar;Even Mufasa came here when he was your age. Refused to leave until his roar could be heard above the rim.
1994-10-18T10:00:40Z;Simba (cub);All the way up there?
1994-10-18T10:00:45Z;Scar;That's when you know you've found it! With a little practice, you'll never be called a cub again!
1994-10-18T10:00:50Z;Simba (cub);Watch this! (soft cub roar)
1994-10-18T10:00:55Z;Scar;You'll get it, Simba. Just takes time. I'll check on you later.
1994-10-18T10:01:00Z;Simba (cub);Dad will be so proud, won't he?
1994-10-18T10:01:05Z;Scar;It's a gift he'll never forget...
1994-10-18T10:10:00Z;Scar;Simba! What have you done?!
1994-10-18T10:10:05Z;Simba (cub);It was a stampede! He tried to save me! It was an accident! I didn't mean for it to...
1994-10-18T10:10:10Z;Scar;Of course you didn't. No one ever means for these things to happen. But the king is dead, and if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive! Your father had such hopes for you, gave you so many chances, and this is how you repay him!
1994-10-18T10:10:15Z;Simba (cub);I didn't know! I didn't know!
1994-10-18T10:10:20Z;Scar;Oh, what will your mother think? A son who causes his father's death! A boy who kills a king!
1994-10-18T10:10:25Z;Simba (cub);What am I gonna do?
1994-10-18T10:10:30Z;Scar;Run. Run away, Simba! Run away and never return!
1994-10-18T11:00:00Z;Scar;Mufasa's death is a terrible tragedy! The greatest leader the pride has ever known. To lose a brother, such a deep, personal loss. And little Simba, who had barely begun to live. A cub whose blood held our future. It's almost too much to endure. I only wish I had gotten to the gorge in time... Been there to save them! And so it is with a heavy heart that I must assume the throne. Mufasa and Simba are gone, which means I am YOUR king! But I must admit: I cannot bear this burden alone, and I will need some help, to ensure the safety of the pride. And so, from the ashes of this tragedy, we shall welcome the dawning of a new era, a great and glorious future!
1994-10-20T11:00:00Z;Pumbaa;Oh no! It's a little lion!
1994-10-20T11:00:05Z;Simba (cub);Who are you?
1994-10-20T11:00:10Z;Timon;We're the guys who saved your life. Risked everything. Fought off angry vultures!
1994-10-20T11:00:15Z;Pumbaa;Hordes of them. Flocks. I'm Pumbaa. This is Timon.
1994-10-20T11:00:20Z;Timon;So, how are you in as few words as possible?
1994-10-20T11:00:25Z;Simba (cub);I did something terrible... I don't wanna talk about it...
1994-10-20T11:00:30Z;Pumbaa;Look, kid, we've all made mistakes! Uh, there must be something we can do, right?
1994-10-20T11:00:35Z;Simba (cub);Not unless you can change the past.
1994-10-20T11:00:40Z;Timon;You know what you can change? The future! That's our specialty!
1994-10-20T11:00:45Z;Simba (cub);How can you change something that hasn't happened?
1994-10-20T11:00:50Z;Timon;Well, to change the future, you got to put your past behind you.
1994-10-20T11:00:55Z;Pumbaa;Way behind!
1994-10-20T11:01:00Z;Timon;Look, kid! Bad things happen, and you can't do anything about it, right?
1994-10-20T11:01:05Z;Simba (cub);Right...
1994-10-20T11:01:10Z;Timon;WRONG! When the world turns the back you, you turn your back on the world!
1994-10-20T11:01:15Z;Pumbaa;And only embrace what's next!
1994-10-20T11:01:20Z;Timon;And turn the what into so what?
1994-10-20T11:01:25Z;Simba (cub);Well, that's not what I was taught.
1994-10-20T11:01:30Z;Timon;Well, then maybe you need a new lesson. Repeat after me, kid: Hakuna matata.
1994-10-20T11:01:35Z;Simba (cub);What?!
1994-10-20T11:01:40Z;Pumbaa;Hakuna matata
1994-10-20T11:01:45Z;Timon;Hakuna matata!
1994-10-20T11:01:50Z;Pumbaa;Most people get a bigger reaction when they say if the first... Okay, well anyway. Hakuna matata. It means no worries.
1994-10-20T11:01:55Z;Timon;Hakuna matata. What a wonderful phrase.
1994-10-20T11:02:00Z;Pumbaa;Hakuna matata. It ain't no passing craze.
1994-10-20T11:02:05Z;Timon;It means no worries for the rest of your days. It's our problem free philosophy. Hakuna matata.
1994-10-20T11:02:10Z;Simba (cub);It means no worries for the rest of your days. It's our problem free philosophy. Hakuna matata.
1994-10-20T11:30:00Z;Timon;Welcome to our humble home.
1994-10-20T11:30:05Z;Simba (cub);It's beautiful!
1995-09-01T09:00:00Z;Sarabi;The morning report, Zazu.
1995-09-01T09:00:05Z;Zazu;Your Majesty, the Pride Lands are in imminent danger. The hyenas are chasing of the last of the herds.
1995-09-01T09:00:10Z;Nala;We have to do something, Sarabi! We have to fight!
1995-09-01T09:00:15Z;Sarabi;Nala, Scar is the king.
1995-09-01T09:00:20Z;Nala;But you are our QUEEN! We should leave before it's too late!
1995-09-01T09:00:25Z;Sarabi;We must all stay together and protect the Pride Lands. This is our home. we must never abandon it.
1995-09-01T09:00:30Z;Nala;This isn't the home I remember.
1995-09-01T09:00:35Z;Sarabi;Our time will come, Nala! Be patient.
1995-09-01T21:00:00Z;Zazu;Just what do you think you are doing, young lady?
1995-09-01T21:00:05Z;Nala;Go away, Zazu. I'm going to find help.
1995-09-01T21:00:10Z;Zazu;I will very much not go away. I am sworn to protect you and must order you back to bed.
1995-09-01T21:00:15Z;Nala;I don't need protecting anymore.
1995-09-02T09:00:00Z;Rafiki;Simba is alive!!!
1995-09-03T09:00:00Z;Timon;RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! RUN PUMBAA, RUN!!!
1995-09-03T09:01:00Z;Pumbaa;Timon, help!!!
1995-09-03T09:02:00Z;Timon;Pumbaa!!!
1995-09-03T09:03:00Z;Pumbaa;I'M GONNA DIE!!!
1995-09-03T09:05:00Z;Simba;Nala!?
1995-09-03T09:05:05Z;Nala;Simba!? Is that really you?
1995-09-03T09:05:10Z;Simba;Yeah!!! It's me, Simba!
1995-09-03T09:05:15Z;Nala;Where have you been? I thought you were dead!
1995-09-03T09:05:20Z;Pumbaa;I thought you were gonna eat me.
1995-09-03T09:05:25Z;Timon;How do you two know each other?
1995-09-03T09:05:30Z;Simba;Timon, Pumbaa, I want you to meet my best friend, Nala!
1995-09-03T09:05:35Z;Nala;Simba, we need to leave! Scar has taken over with the hyenas. You have to take your place as king.
1995-09-03T09:05:40Z;Timon;King?! Simba?! 
1995-09-03T09:05:45Z;Nala;Seing you again, you don't know what this will mean to everyone, what this means to me! You have to come home.
1995-09-03T09:05:50Z;Simba;This IS my home. Please stay. This place is incredible. I know you'll love it.
1995-09-03T09:05:55Z;Nala;I can't.
1995-09-03T09:06:00Z;Simba;C'mon! At least let me show you around.
1995-09-03T09:06:05Z;Nala;Where are you going?!
1995-09-03T10:00:00Z;Nala;Simba, it's so beautiful.
1995-09-03T10:00:05Z;Simba;I told you. Isn't it great here? You know, maybe it could be like this forever.
1995-09-03T10:00:10Z;Nala;It's amazing. But there's something I don't understand: If you've been alive all this time, why haven't you come home? We've really needed you.
1995-09-03T10:00:15Z;Simba;They're fine, all right? Nobody needs me.
1995-09-03T10:00:20Z;Nala;You're the king!
1995-09-03T10:00:25Z;Simba;Nala, SCAR is the king.
1995-09-03T10:00:30Z;Nala;Simba, he's decimated the Pride Lands! There's no food, no water...
1995-09-03T10:00:35Z;Simba;There's nothing I can do.
1995-09-03T10:00:40Z;Nala;What about your mother? This is your responsibility! You need to chalenge Scar!
1995-09-03T10:00:45Z;Simba;I can't go back! EVER!
1995-09-03T10:00:50Z;Nala;Why? Because of what happened at the gorge? Scar told us that...
1995-09-03T10:00:55Z;Simba;You wouldn't understand... None of it matters, okay? Hakuna Matata.
1995-09-03T10:01:00Z;Nala;What?!
1995-09-03T10:01:05Z;Simba;It's something I learned out here, okay? You see, sometimes bad things happen, and there's nothing you can do about it. So, why worry?
1995-09-03T10:01:10Z;Nala;Why worry?! What happened to you?! You're not the Simba I remember!
1995-09-03T10:01:15Z;Simba;And I never will be, are you satisfied?
1995-09-03T10:01:20Z;Nala;No, I'm disappointed.
1995-09-03T10:01:25Z;Simba;You know, now you're starting to sound like my father.
1995-09-03T10:01:30Z;Nala;Good! I'm glad one of us does!
1995-09-03T10:01:35Z;Simba;YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH!!!
1995-09-03T10:01:40Z;Nala;I came here looking for help. I guess I made a mistake. Goodbye, Simba...
1995-09-03T18:00:00Z;Simba;Go away!
1995-09-03T18:00:05Z;Rafiki;Going away will not answer the question!
1995-09-03T18:00:10Z;Simba;What question? Who are you?
1995-09-03T18:00:15Z;Rafiki;I know exactly who I am. The question is: Who are you?
1995-09-03T18:00:20Z;Simba;I'm nobody. So leave me alone, all right?
1995-09-03T18:00:25Z;Rafiki;Everybody is somebody. Even a nobody.
1995-09-03T18:00:30Z;Simba;Yeah, I think you're confused.
1995-09-03T18:00:35Z;Rafiki;I am confused? You don't even know who you are!
1995-09-03T18:00:40Z;Simba;Oh! And I suppose you do?
1995-09-03T18:00:45Z;Rafiki;I held the son of Mufasa.
1995-09-03T18:00:50Z;Simba;You knew my father?
1995-09-03T18:00:55Z;Rafiki;Correction: I KNOW your father.
1995-09-03T18:01:00Z;Simba;He died a long time ago.
1995-09-03T18:01:05Z;Rafiki;He's alive!!! And I can take you to him. Follow me, I will show you! If you can keep up!
1995-09-03T18:01:10Z;Simba;Wait!
1995-09-03T18:30:00Z;Rafiki;Come... Your father is waiting... Do you see him?
1995-09-03T18:30:05Z;Simba;I don't see anything.
1995-09-03T18:30:10Z;Rafiki;Look closer... You see? He lives in you.
1995-09-03T18:30:15Z;Mufasa (spirit);Simba.
1995-09-03T18:30:20Z;Simba;Dad?
1995-09-03T18:30:25Z;Mufasa (spirit);Simba, you must take your place in the circle of life.
1995-09-03T18:30:30Z;Simba;I can't.
1995-09-03T18:30:35Z;Mufasa (spirit);You must remember who you are: The one true king.
1995-09-03T18:30:40Z;Simba;I'm sorry. I don't know how to be like you.
1995-09-03T18:30:45Z;Mufasa (spirit);As king, I was most proud of one thing: Having you as my son.
1995-09-03T18:30:50Z;Simba;That was a long time ago...
1995-09-03T18:30:55Z;Mufasa (spirit);No, Simba. That is forever.
1995-09-03T18:31:00Z;Simba;Please, don't leave me again.
1995-09-03T18:31:05Z;Mufasa (spirit);I never left you. And never will. Remember who you are. Remember.
1995-09-03T18:31:10Z;Rafiki;And so, I ask again: Who are you?
1995-09-03T18:31:15Z;Simba;... I am Simba. Son of Mufasa! (ROAR)
1995-09-04T09:00:00Z;Nala;Simba?
1995-09-04T09:00:05Z;Simba;C'mon! What are you waiting for? Let's go home!
1995-09-06T15:00:00Z;Simba;I didn't wanna believe you.
1995-09-06T15:00:05Z;Nala;So, what are you gonna do?
1995-09-06T15:00:10Z;Simba;My father once told me to protect everything the light touches. If I don't fight for it, who will?
1995-09-06T15:00:15Z;Nala;I will.
1995-09-06T15:00:20Z;Simba;It's going to be dangerous.
1995-09-06T15:00:25Z;Nala;Danger? Ha! I laugh in the face of danger!
1995-09-06T15:00:30Z;Zazu;It can't be!
1995-09-06T15:00:35Z;Simba;Hello Zazu!
1995-09-06T15:00:40Z;Zazu;Your majesty! Welcome home!
1995-09-06T15:00:45Z;Pumbaa;We're here!
1995-09-06T15:00:50Z;Timon;Everyone, calm down! We're here!
1995-09-06T15:00:55Z;Pumbaa;The backup has arrived!
1995-09-06T15:30:00Z;Scar;Sarabi, why put yourself through this? All you have to do is be my queen! You're suffering for what? The memory of a life you once knew? A king you once loved? I tried to make you understand what a TRUE king can be.
1995-09-06T15:30:05Z;Sarabi;Scar, a true king's power is his compassion.
1995-09-06T15:30:10Z;Scar;I AM TEN TIMES THE KING MUFASA WAS!
1995-09-06T15:30:15Z;Sarabi;You are nothing compared to Mufasa!
1995-09-06T15:30:20Z;Mufasa (spirit);(ROAR)
1995-09-06T15:30:25Z;Scar;Mufasa?! It can't be!!!
1995-09-06T15:30:30Z;Mufasa (spirit);GET AWAY FROM MY MOTHER!!!
1995-09-06T15:30:35Z;Sarabi;Simba! You're alive?! How can that be?!
1995-09-06T15:30:40Z;Simba;I'm here, mother. I'm home.
1995-09-06T15:30:45Z;Scar;Simba, I'm so happy to see you... alive.
1995-09-06T15:30:50Z;Simba;Give me one good reason why I shouldn't rip you apart!
1995-09-06T15:30:55Z;Scar;I can give you more than one. You see, the hyenas think I'm king.
1995-09-06T15:31:00Z;Nala;Well, we don't! Your reign is over, Scar! Simba is the rightful king! If you wanna get him, you have to get through us! Are you with me, lions?
1995-09-06T15:31:05Z;Simba;The choice is yours, Scar. Step down or fight.
1995-09-06T15:31:10Z;Scar;Must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. To feel the shame of knowing I took the life of someone I love.
1995-09-06T15:31:15Z;Simba;I put all that behind me.
1995-09-06T15:31:20Z;Scar;But have they put it behind them? Do your faithful subjects know what you've done?
1995-09-06T15:31:25Z;Sarabi;What is he talking about?
1995-09-06T15:31:30Z;Scar;So you haven't told them your little secret? Well, Simba... now's your chance to confess. Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death!
1995-09-06T15:31:35Z;Simba;... It was me...
1995-09-06T15:31:40Z;Sarabi;It's not true. Tell me it's not true.
1995-09-06T15:31:45Z;Simba;It's true. I'm sorry.
1995-09-06T15:31:50Z;Scar;He admits it! Murderer!
1995-09-06T15:31:55Z;Simba;No! No! It was an accident!
1995-09-06T15:32:00Z;Scar;If it weren't for you the king would be alive! It's your fault he's dead! Do you deny it?
1995-09-06T15:32:05Z;Simba;I'm not a murderer!
1995-09-06T15:32:10Z;Scar;We should believe the son who takes the life of a father? We should believe the son who takes the life of a king? A son who abandons his mother?
1995-09-06T15:32:15Z;Simba;No, I'm...
1995-09-06T15:32:20Z;Scar;You're what? Say it! Are you the king?
1995-09-06T15:32:25Z;Simba;No. No, I'm...
1995-09-06T15:32:30Z;Scar;ARE YOU THE KING?
1995-09-06T15:32:35Z;Simba;No, I'm...
1995-09-06T15:32:40Z;Scar;You're what? SAY IT!!!
1995-09-06T15:32:45Z;Simba;I'm... I'm nothing...
1995-09-06T15:32:50Z;Scar;Then BOW to you king!
1995-09-06T15:32:55Z;Sarabi;Simba!
1995-09-06T15:33:00Z;Scar;This looks familiar. Where have I seen this before? Oh, yes! I remember! This is the way Mufasa looked before he died. I looked down... saw the fear in his eyes. And here's my little secret: I... killed... Mufasa!
1995-09-06T15:33:05Z;Simba;MY FATHER! YOUR OWN BROTHER! HOW COULD YOU?!
1995-09-06T15:33:10Z;Scar;First he kills Mufasa! Now he wants to kill me!
1995-09-06T15:33:15Z;Simba;YOU KILLED HIM! TELL THEM THE TRUTH!
1995-09-06T15:33:20Z;Scar;Don't believe his lies!
1995-09-06T15:33:25Z;Sarabi;Scar... You told us you didn't get to the gorge in time...
1995-09-06T15:33:30Z;Scar;That's true!
1995-09-06T15:33:35Z;Sarabi;Then how did you see the look in Mufasa's eyes?
1995-09-06T15:33:40Z;Simba;MURDERER!
1995-09-06T15:33:45Z;Scar;HYENAS, KILL THEM ALL!!!
1995-09-06T16:00:00Z;Simba;It's over Scar!
1995-09-06T16:00:05Z;Scar;Have mercy, I beg you!
1995-09-06T16:00:10Z;Simba;Mercy? After what you did?
1995-09-06T16:00:15Z;Scar;It was the hyenas! Those revolting scavengers made me do it! I was planning on killing them all!
1995-09-06T16:00:20Z;Simba;You fooled the hyenas! Just like you fooled me!
1995-09-06T16:00:25Z;Scar;Simba... you wouldn't kill your only uncle!
1995-09-06T16:00:30Z;Simba;No, Scar! I'm not like you!
1995-09-06T16:00:35Z;Scar;Oh, Simba... you are truly noble! And I will make it up to you! Just tell me how I can prove myself. Tell me what you want me to do.
1995-09-06T16:00:40Z;Simba;Run. Run away, Scar. Run away and never return.
1995-09-06T16:00:45Z;Scar;... Yes... Of course... As you wish... your majesty
1995-09-06T16:00:50Z;Simba;You can't win Scar!
1995-09-06T16:00:55Z;Scar;This is my kingdom! My destiny!
1995-09-06T16:05:00Z;Simba;I defeated Scar!
1995-09-06T19:30:00Z;Scar;My friends. It will take some time, but together we will build our army.
1995-09-06T19:30:05Z;Kamari;Friends, huh? I thought you said we were revolting scavengers! Yeah, that you wanted to kill us!
1995-09-06T19:30:10Z;Scar;No! No, let me explain! I was trying to fool him! We will rule together!
1995-09-06T19:30:15Z;Shenzi;There's only one true thing you ever said, Scar: A hyena's belly is never full!
1995-09-07T09:00:00Z;Zazu;Your majesty!
1995-09-07T09:00:05Z;Mufasa (spirit);Remember!
1995-09-07T09:00:10Z;Simba;(ROAR)
1995-09-07T09:00:15Z;Nala;(ROAR)
1995-09-07T09:00:20Z;Sarabi;(ROAR)
1995-12-27T09:00:20Z;Simba;Nala gave birth to a cub!
